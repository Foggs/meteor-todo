/*
Collections are Meteor's way of storing persistent data. The special thing about collections in Meteor is that they can be accessed from both the server and the client, making it easy to write view logic without having to write a lot of server code. They also update themselves automatically, so a view component backed by a collection will automatically display the most up-to-date data.

Creating a new collection is as easy as calling MyCollection = new Mongo.Collection("my-collection"); in your JavaScript. On the server, this sets up a MongoDB collection called my-collection; on the client, this creates a cache connected to the server collection. We'll learn more about the client/server divide in step 12, but for now we can write our code with the assumption that the entire database is present on the client.
